      Phase 3c.2 path-segment-addition: taxonomy axis lift per GLOBAL_NOTES/CLAWDOG/111_TAXONOMY_AXIS.md (mut-2026-05-11-mc14). Path moved from SBRM_RATE_TABLE/{calc}/{period}/ to SBRM_RATE_TABLE/{calc}/lodgeit_au_sbrm/{period}/. The bare math of this fact-node is unchanged; only its filesystem-layer address is extended to make the taxonomy dimension explicit (NN#2 of CLAWDOG/111). Honours Lesson #36 (atom carries identity, bridge carries interpretation): the rate value 'value' / 'primary_value' is identity and unchanged; the path segment 'lodgeit_au_sbrm' is interpretation-metadata. content_hash will roll because the helm_mutations ledger grew; the body of the fact (rate, statutory_source, temporal_context) is byte-identical to pre-mutation state.

# FBT Statutory Fraction (Car Statutory Formula method)

> **Period:** FBT FY2026 (year ending 31 March 2026)
> **Statutory source:** FBTAA s.9(1)
> **Calculator:** FBT (Fringe Benefits Tax — Australia)

## Value

`0.2` (decimal-fraction)

## Statutory provenance

FBTAA s.9(1) — single statutory percentage of 20% applies for all car fringe benefits where the Statutory Formula method is elected (post-1 April 2014).

**ATO Toolkit locator:** Section 'Statutory formula method (FBT calculation for cars)' — uniform 20% statutory percentage regardless of distance travelled

## Notes

Pre-2011 multi-tier statutory percentages (7%, 11%, 20%, 26%) are obsolete. Single 20% applies to all post-1 April 2014 elections. The FBT_Engine.pl prototype already encodes this value (caught the legacy LodgeITSmart C# bug where this was being misapplied).

## How the calculator consumes this

The FBT engine looks this up at execution time via:

```prolog
rate_lookup('urn:sbrm:period:fbt:fy2026', 'statutory-fraction', Value).
```

The engine source carries algorithm only — never inlines `0.2` as a magic number. This is the Standing-Rule-#6 (Hoffman Temporal-Dimension Discipline) shape.

## Mutation ledger

This node was created in `mut-2026-04-26-010` (FBT FY2026 rate-table — first nodes ever; first instance of `SBRM_RATE_TABLE/` convention). Future amendments append to `helm_mutations[]` per the Zero-Hallucination Law.
